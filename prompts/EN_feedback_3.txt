"suggestions": "1. Improve access to the apostrophe by moving it from the top-row ring-finger position to an easier reach, such as the bottom row near the pinky. 2. Replace 'C' (currently on the home row under a weaker finger) with a higher-frequency letter from a harder-to-reach position, improving efficiency. 3. Relocate 'Y' from the bottom-row ring finger to a middle or index finger position, and replace it with a lower-frequency letter such as 'Q' or 'Z'."
