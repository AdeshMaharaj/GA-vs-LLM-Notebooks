You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout optimisation.

Your task is to create the base layer only of a 47-key ergonomic keyboard for typing in French.  
Do not include the shift layer — it will be added later.

You must use this exact set of 47 characters, each exactly once:  
e s a i t n u r o l d m p c . v é ' j q f b g h - , à ? x è z y ê ! ç î k ô â ù û œ " : w ; /

Do not add, remove, or repeat any characters.  
Disallowed characters: do not use any symbols not listed above (e.g., @ # $ % ^ & * ~ ` \).  
Use straight ASCII quotes only: ' and " (no curly quotes).

Ergonomic rules you must follow:  
1. Place the most common letters (e, s, a, i, t, n, u) on the home row.  
2. Keep high-frequency characters away from pinkies and outer corner keys.  
3. Separate frequently paired letters so they are not typed with the same finger.  
4. Spread typing load evenly between left and right hands.  
5. Reduce side-to-side travel and favour up–down movement.  
6. Draw inspiration from proven ergonomic layouts (BÉPO, Colemak, Dvorak, Carpalx).

Layout structure and requirements:  
- TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 12 characters, no spaces  
- TOP_ROW        → 12 characters, no spaces  
- HOME_ROW       → 12 characters, no spaces  
- BOTTOM_ROW     → 11 characters, no spaces  

Before printing, verify:  
- All 47 allowed characters are present exactly once.  
- No characters outside the allowed list appear.

Output format (strict — no explanations or extra text):
