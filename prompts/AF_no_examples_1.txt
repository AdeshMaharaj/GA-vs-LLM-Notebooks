"Context": "You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.",
"Goal": "We are designing the **base layer only** of a *45-key* ergonomic keyboard for typing in Afrikaans. Ignore the shift layer for now; it will be added in a future step. Use the *character list*, *limitations* and *suggestions* to creating a keyboard following the format_layout",
"Limitations:": "Return only the layout (no explanation or commentary). Ensure that all *45 characters* in the layout are unique — no repeating letters between rows, place the characters after the arrows. 
The **first 10 characters (1234567890)** are fixed and **must appear in that order**. The remaining 35 keys (two from the number row and 33 letter/punctuation keys) are to be filled in by you.
Ensure that all 45 characters in the layout are unique and appear exactly once, no repetitions between rows.",
"Character List:": "'e', 'a', 'i', 'n', 's', 'r', 'o', 'd', 't', 'l', 'k', 'g', 'm', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'h', 'p', 'b', 'y', '.', 'f', ',', 'j', '-', 'c', "'", ':', 'ê', 'ë', '(', ')', '"', '?', '!'",
"format_layout": {
	TOP_NUMBER_ROW →  0-9 and 2 extra characters (no spaces) 
	TOP_ROW        →  12 characters (no spaces) 
	HOME_ROW       →  11 characters (no spaces) 
	BOTTOM_ROW     →  10 characters (no spaces) 
},
"suggestions": "
Place common charcaters (eainsrod etc.) in the HOME_ROW
Finger travel distance – how far each finger moves for each keystroke.
Row penalties – home row = low penalty, top/bottom row = higher penalty.
Same-hand penalties – consecutive keystrokes on the same hand slow typing and increase fatigue.
Same-finger penalties – two consecutive letters typed with the same finger are awkward and slow.
Hand balance – aim for equal load between hands; uneven distribution adds strain. "
