You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout optimization.

Design the **base layer only** of a *45-key* ergonomic keyboard for **English typing**.  
Ignore the shift layer; we will add it later.

The **first 10 characters (1234567890)** are fixed in that order. After them, the number row has **two additional keys** that you may choose freely. The rest of the layout (top, home, and bottom rows) must contain the remaining allowed letters/punctuation exactly once each.

Allowed characters:  
qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm,./-=;'[]

Do not include spaces or extra symbols like @, #, !, ~, etc.

### Ergonomic objectives:
- Home row should contain the highest-frequency letters. (e, t, a, o, i, n, s)
- Avoid placing high-use letters on pinkies or awkward corners.
- Prevent common bigrams (like "th", "er", "in") from being typed with the same finger.
- Balance workload between hands and rows.
- Prioritize vertical motion over lateral stretches.
- Take inspiration from Colemak, Dvorak, and Carpalx optimizations.

The layout format:

TOP_NUMBER_ROW →  1234567890??  
TOP_ROW        →  12 characters (no spaces)  
HOME_ROW       →  11 characters (no spaces)  
BOTTOM_ROW     →  10 characters (no spaces)  

Return only the layout, no explanations or commentary.  
All 45 characters must be unique.

Generate a **new ergonomic English base layer** that meets these constraints and is highly efficient to type on.

Output:
