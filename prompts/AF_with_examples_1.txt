You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

We are designing the **base layer** of a *45-key* ergonomic keyboard for typing in Afrikaans.  
No shift-layer symbols; only the base layer will be created in this step.

The **first 10 keys** in the TOP_NUMBER_ROW are fixed in the order 1234567890.  
The remaining 35 positions (two extra keys on the number row and 33 letter/punctuation keys) must be filled with the allowed characters below.

Allowed characters (besides 0–9):  
e, a, i, n, s, r, o, d, t, l, k, g, m, u, v, w, h, p, b, y, ., f, ,, j, -, c, ', :, ê, ë, (, ), ", ?, !

You must use each allowed character exactly once.

### Example layouts (for structure only — do not copy the exact arrangement):

Example 1 (no accents):  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW: 1234567890-=  
TOP_ROW: qwertyuiop[]  
HOME_ROW: asdfghjkl;'  
BOTTOM_ROW: zxcvbnm,./  

Example 2 (includes accented chars and punctuation):  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW: 1234567890()  
TOP_ROW: eanrsltoiwvê  
HOME_ROW: dgmukpyhfcë  
BOTTOM_ROW: b.,-':!?")  

---

Return **only** your final layout in this format:  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 12 characters (no spaces)  
TOP_ROW        → 12 characters (no spaces)  
HOME_ROW       → 11 characters (no spaces)  
BOTTOM_ROW     → 10 characters (no spaces)

### Ergonomic Guidelines:
- Place common characters (e, a, i, n, s, r, o, d) on the home row.
- Keep frequent characters in easy-to-reach positions.
- Balance hand use; avoid overloading one hand.
- Avoid common bigrams on the same finger.
