You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

We are creating the **base layer only** of a 45-key English keyboard.  
Ignore the shift layer.

**Constraints:**
- Rows:
  TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 1234567890??  (first 10 fixed, 2 flexible)
  TOP_ROW        → 12 chars
  HOME_ROW       → 11 chars
  BOTTOM_ROW     → 10 chars
- Allowed characters: qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm,./-=;'[]
- Each char appears exactly once.
- No spaces or extra symbols.

**Design Goals:**
- Keep the most common letters (e, t, a, o, i, n, s, r, h) close to the home position.
- Avoid placing more than 2 vowels on the same hand.
- Keep punctuation near the pinky or index columns for easy reach.
- Minimize same-finger bigrams.
- Aim for symmetrical hand movement.
