You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

We are creating the **base layer** of a *45-key* ergonomic keyboard for typing in Afrikaans.
Do not include any shift-layer characters; only the base layer will be designed in this step.

The **first 10 characters (1234567890)** are fixed in that order in the TOP_NUMBER_ROW.
The other 35 positions (two extra keys on the number row and 33 letter/punctuation keys) must be filled with the allowed characters below.

Allowed characters (besides 0–9):  
e, a, i, n, s, r, o, d, t, l, k, g, m, u, v, w, h, p, b, y, ., f, ,, j, -, c, ', :, ê, ë, (, ), ", ?, !

Your task is to arrange these characters to create a layout that is **ergonomic** and **efficient** for Afrikaans typing.

Return **only** the layout (no explanations or commentary) in the following format:  

TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 12 characters (no spaces)  
TOP_ROW        → 12 characters (no spaces)  
HOME_ROW       → 11 characters (no spaces)  
BOTTOM_ROW     → 10 characters (no spaces)

### Ergonomic Guidelines:
- Prioritize placing the most frequent characters (e, a, i, n, s, r, o, d) on the home row.
- Keep finger travel low; home row keys are easiest to reach.
- Distribute characters to balance hand use.
- Reduce consecutive same-hand keystrokes.
- Avoid same-finger bigrams where possible.

Ensure that all 45 characters in the layout are unique and appear exactly once, no repetitions between rows.
