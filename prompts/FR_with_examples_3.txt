You are an expert in designing efficient, ergonomic French keyboard layouts.

Produce the base layer for a 47-key layout (ignore the shift layer).

Allowed set (47 total). Your four rows must be a **permutation of this set** — each character used once, none omitted, none added:

e s a i t n u r o l d m p c . v é ' j q f b g h - , à ? x è z y ê ! ç î k ô â ù û œ " : w ; /

Hard constraints:
- No duplicates and no characters outside the allowed set.
- Use only ASCII ' and " (no curly quotes).
- The following characters MUST appear exactly once each, never more: e, i, o, u, é, è, ê, à, î, û, ô, œ.
- All four rows combined must use all 47 characters exactly once.

Ergonomic rules:
- Prioritise e, s, a, i, t, n, u on the home row.
- Avoid placing frequent letters on pinky extremes.
- Keep common bigram partners on different fingers.
- Balance typing effort between left/right hands and minimise lateral motion.

FORMAT EXAMPLE (placeholders only):
TOP_NUMBER_ROW → ••••••••••••
TOP_ROW        → ••••••••••••
HOME_ROW       → ••••••••••••
BOTTOM_ROW     → •••••••••••

Row requirements:
TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 12 characters
TOP_ROW        → 12 characters
HOME_ROW       → 12 characters
BOTTOM_ROW     → 11 characters
(all rows contain characters with no spaces)

Silent validation before printing (do not show work):
1) Concatenate all four rows; after sorting, it must exactly match the sorted allowed set above.
2) Ensure each of the listed vowel/accent characters appears exactly once.

Return only:
TOP_NUMBER_ROW:
TOP_ROW:
HOME_ROW:
BOTTOM_ROW:
