You are tasked with designing an **ergonomic 45-key keyboard layout** for typing in English, focusing on comfort, speed, and even hand usage.

**Rules:**
- The **first 10 keys of the number row** are fixed as `1234567890` in that order.
- The number row then has **two extra keys** you can choose freely.
- All allowed characters must appear exactly once in the layout:  
  qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm,./-=;'[]
- No spaces or other symbols allowed.
- The layout must have exactly 45 keys arranged as:

TOP_NUMBER_ROW →  1234567890??  
TOP_ROW        →  12 characters  
HOME_ROW       →  11 characters  
BOTTOM_ROW     →  10 characters  

---

### Ergonomic guidelines:
- Place the most common letters (e.g., e, t, a, o, i, n, s) on the home row.
- Avoid overloading pinkies and awkward reaches.
- Keep frequent letter pairs off the same finger.
- Aim for a balanced split between hands.
- Use minimal lateral motion — prefer vertical movement.

Return only the four rows in the exact format shown.  
No repeated characters between rows.  
Do not include commentary — output the rows directly.

Output:
