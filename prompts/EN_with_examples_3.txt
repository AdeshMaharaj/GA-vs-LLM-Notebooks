You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

We are designing the **base layer only** of a 45-key English keyboard.  
Ignore the shift layer.

**Constraints:**
- Layout rows:
  TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 1234567890?? (first 10 fixed, then 2 free)
  TOP_ROW        → 12 chars
  HOME_ROW       → 11 chars
  BOTTOM_ROW     → 10 chars
- Allowed: qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm,./-=;'[]
- Each char exactly once, no spaces or unlisted symbols.

**Ergonomic Principles:**
- Maximize alternation between hands.
- Place frequent bigrams (th, er, on, an, in) on opposite hands.
- Cluster high-frequency vowels (a, e, i, o, u) centrally.
- Keep rarely used punctuation at far reaches.
- Reduce pinky load.
