You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

We are designing the **base layer only** of a 45-key ergonomic keyboard for English.  
Ignore the shift layer for now.

**Constraints:**
- Layout has 4 rows and The full layout must include exactly:

TOP_NUMBER_ROW →  0-9 and 2 extra characters (no spaces) 
TOP_ROW        →  12 characters (no spaces) 
HOME_ROW       →  11 characters (no spaces) 
BOTTOM_ROW     →  10 characters (no spaces) 

- Allowed characters: qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm,./-=;'[]
- Each character must appear exactly once.
- No spaces, backticks, tildes, or symbols like @, #, !.

**Ergonomic Guidelines:**
- Place most frequent letters (e, t, a, o, i, n, s) on the home row.
- Avoid high-frequency letters on pinkies.
- Avoid assigning common bigrams (th, er, in) to the same finger.
- Balance effort between hands, minimize lateral motion.
- Use ergonomic patterns from Colemak, Dvorak, or Carpalx for inspiration.
