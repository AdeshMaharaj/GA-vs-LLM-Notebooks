You are given an Afrikaans keyboard layout generated by a genetic algorithm.  
Your task is to make at least **6 changes** to improve the ergonomics based on the heatmap provided.  
Use the same 47 allowed characters already present in the layout — do not introduce new characters or remove any.  
All four rows must retain their original lengths:  
- top_number_row: 12 characters  
- top_row: 12 characters  
- home_row: 12 characters  
- bottom_row: 11 characters  

Return ONLY a JSON object with the following keys:  
top_number_row, top_row, home_row, bottom_row.  
Each value should be a single string of the correct length, no spaces or separators.  

Current layout:  
{
   'top_number_row': '1234567890?z', 
   'top_row': '"cyfgltuj\'éë', 
   'home_row': 'hkroesanidv', 
   'bottom_row': '!:pbmw.,-ê'
}
