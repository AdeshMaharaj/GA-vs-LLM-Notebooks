Take into consideration the heatmap and below to improve this layout
Finger travel distance – how far each finger moves for each keystroke.
Row penalties – home row = low penalty, top/bottom row = higher penalty.
Same-hand penalties – consecutive keystrokes on the same hand slow typing and increase fatigue.
Same-finger penalties – two consecutive letters typed with the same finger are awkward and slow.
Hand balance – aim for equal load between hands; uneven distribution adds strain. "
