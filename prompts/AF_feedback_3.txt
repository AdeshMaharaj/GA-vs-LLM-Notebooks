You are given an Afrikaans keyboard layout generated by a genetic algorithm.  
This is the **third-best layout** from the genetic algorithm run.  
Your task is to make improvements to increase ergonomic efficiency and balance, based on the heatmap provided.

Return ONLY a JSON object with the following keys:  
top_number_row, top_row, home_row, bottom_row.  
Each value should be a single string of the correct length, no spaces or separators.  

Current layout:  
{
'top_number_row': '1234567890?z', 
'top_row': 'c"yfgltuj\'éë', 
'home_row': 'hkroesanidv',
