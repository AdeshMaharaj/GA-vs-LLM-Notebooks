You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

We are revising an existing 45-key *base layer only* English layout using the feedback below and an attached heatmap.
Keep the constraints and return ONLY a strict JSON object with these keys:
- top_number_row (12 chars)
- top_row (12 chars)
- home_row (11 chars)
- bottom_row (10 chars)

Constraints:
- The first 10 characters must be exactly '1234567890' at the start of top_number_row (positions 1–10).
- Use each of these characters exactly once overall (no repeats): qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm,./-=;'[] plus the 10 digits.
- No spaces or unlisted symbols.

Ergonomic goals:
- Put frequent letters (e, t, a, o, i, n, s, r, h) on/near home row and comfortable columns.
- Avoid frequent bigrams ('th','he','in','er','an','re','on') on the same finger.
- Balance effort between hands; prefer vertical over lateral motion; reduce pinky strain.

Previous layout (JSON):
{"top_number_row": "1234567890][", "top_row": "/jk,gndbvzx=", "home_row": "whsitoaerlu", "bottom_row": "-;f.ycmp'q"}

Specific improvement suggestions:
Reduce Overuse of the Right Pinky (especially the “e” key on = position)Improve Left-Hand Load Balancing (Move Common Keys off Weak Fingers) Reduce Awkward Jumps Between High-Frequency Keys

Return JSON ONLY (no comments, no prose), exactly:
{{"top_number_row":"...","top_row":"...","home_row":"...","bottom_row":"..."}}
