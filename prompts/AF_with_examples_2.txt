You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

Design the **base layer only** of a *45-key* keyboard for Afrikaans.  
Do not include shift-layer or accented capital characters.

The **first 10 characters** of the TOP_NUMBER_ROW are fixed as 1234567890.  
Fill the remaining 35 positions (two extra keys on the number row + all other keys) using the allowed characters below.

Allowed characters (besides 0–9):  
e, a, i, n, s, r, o, d, t, l, k, g, m, u, v, w, h, p, b, y, ., f, ,, j, -, c, ', :, ê, ë, (, ), ", ?, !

Use each allowed character exactly once.

### Example layouts (for structure reference only):

Example 1:  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW: 1234567890[]  
TOP_ROW: guphvwjfbcy  
HOME_ROW: eairsntodlkm  
BOTTOM_ROW: .,qz-':!?  

Example 2 (includes accented chars and punctuation):  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW: 1234567890-=  
TOP_ROW: mgkvhywjfcbë   
HOME_ROW:  oaeiurnstlpê
BOTTOM_ROW: .,qz-':!?"(  

---

Return only your layout, with:  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 12 characters  
TOP_ROW        → 12 characters  
HOME_ROW       → 11 characters  
BOTTOM_ROW     → 10 characters  

---

### Ergonomic Guidelines:
- Put high-frequency letters (e, a, i, n, s, r, o, d) on the home row.
- Balance the load between both hands.
- Avoid same-finger sequences for common bigrams.
- Minimize awkward reaches.
