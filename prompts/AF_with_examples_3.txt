You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

We need the **base layer** of a *45-key* ergonomic keyboard for Afrikaans typing.  
Only the base layer will be designed — no shift-layer or capital letters.

The **first 10 characters** of the TOP_NUMBER_ROW are fixed as 1234567890.  
You must fill the remaining 35 keys (two extra number row keys and 33 other keys) with the allowed characters below.

Allowed characters (besides 0–9):  
e, a, i, n, s, r, o, d, t, l, k, g, m, u, v, w, h, p, b, y, ., f, ,, j, -, c, ', :, ê, ë, (, ), ", ?, !

Each allowed character is used exactly once.

### Example layouts (format only — do not copy exact positions):

Example 1:  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW: 1234567890()  
TOP_ROW: eairsntodlkm  
HOME_ROW: guphvwjfbcy  
BOTTOM_ROW: .,qz-':!?  

Example 2:  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW: 1234567890-=  
TOP_ROW: oaeiurnstlpd  
HOME_ROW: mgkvhywjfcb  
BOTTOM_ROW: .,qz-':!?  

---

Your output must follow this format exactly:  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 12 characters  
TOP_ROW        → 12 characters  
HOME_ROW       → 11 characters  
BOTTOM_ROW     → 10 characters  

---

### Ergonomic Guidelines:
- Place frequent letters (e, a, i, n, s, r, o, d) on the home row.
- Reduce lateral finger movement and awkward stretches.
- Balance left/right hand load.
- Avoid same-finger common bigrams.
