You are an expert in ergonomic keyboard layout design.

Design the base layer only of a 47-key ergonomic keyboard for French. Ignore the shift layer.

You must output a **permutation** of this exact 47-character string (use each character exactly once, no others):

esa itn urol dmpc.v é'jqf bgh-, à?x èzy ê!ç îkô âù ûœ ":w;/
(remove spaces in your head; the characters you must use, in order, are:)
e s a i t n u r o l d m p c . v é ' j q f b g h - , à ? x è z y ê ! ç î k ô â ù û œ " : w ; /

Hard constraints:
- Your four rows combined must be a permutation of the above string (47 unique characters, used once each).
- Do not add, remove, or duplicate characters.
- Do not use curly quotes; only ASCII ' and ".
- Do not copy characters from the example; it is placeholders only.

Ergonomic rules (must follow):
- Place e, s, a, i, t, n, u on the home row.
- Keep frequent letters off pinkies and far corners.
- Separate frequent bigram partners across different fingers.
- Balance load between hands; prefer vertical over lateral motion.

FORMAT EXAMPLE (placeholders only):
TOP_NUMBER_ROW → XXXXXXXXXXXX
TOP_ROW        → XXXXXXXXXXXX
HOME_ROW       → XXXXXXXXXXXX
BOTTOM_ROW     → XXXXXXXXXXX

Row requirements:
TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 12 characters (no spaces)
TOP_ROW        → 12 characters (no spaces)
HOME_ROW       → 12 characters (no spaces)
BOTTOM_ROW     → 11 characters (no spaces)

Silent self-check before printing (do not show your work):
- When you concatenate the four rows, the sorted result must exactly match the sorted 47-character string above.

Return only the layout in this exact format:
TOP_NUMBER_ROW:
TOP_ROW:
HOME_ROW:
BOTTOM_ROW:
