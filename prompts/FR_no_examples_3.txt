You are an expert in designing efficient, ergonomic keyboard layouts.

Design the base layer of a 47-key French keyboard.  
Ignore the shift layer; it will be added later.

The 47 allowed characters are:  
e s a i t n u r o l d m p c . v é ' j q f b g h - , à ? x è z y ê ! ç î k ô â ù û œ " : w ; /  
Every character must appear exactly once in your layout.

Do not introduce extra characters, remove any, or duplicate them.  
Disallowed characters: do not use any symbols not listed above (e.g., @ # $ % ^ & * ~ ` \).  
Use straight ASCII quotes only: ' and " (no curly quotes).

French language frequency data:  
Most common bigrams (top 12):  
es 0.0255, en 0.0198, le 0.0179, ou 0.0157, ai 0.0157, re 0.0156, on 0.0137, nt 0.0132, de 0.0131, er 0.0118, te 0.0113, is 0.0110  

Most common single characters (top 12):  
e 0.1411, s 0.0801, a 0.0743, i 0.0665, t 0.0652, n 0.0646, u 0.0607, r 0.0594, o 0.0536, l 0.0509, d 0.0292, m 0.0289

Ergonomic constraints (must comply):  
- The most frequent letters (e, s, a, i, t, n, u) should be placed on the home row.  
- Avoid placing high-frequency characters on pinky columns or far reaches.  
- Keep frequent bigram pairs on different fingers to improve speed and comfort.  
- Ensure balanced workload between both hands.  
- Prioritise vertical over horizontal motion to minimise strain.  
- Base the design on established ergonomic principles from layouts like BÉPO, Colemak, Dvorak, and Carpalx.

Required layout structure:  
TOP_NUMBER_ROW → 12 characters, no spaces  
TOP_ROW        → 12 characters, no spaces  
HOME_ROW       → 12 characters, no spaces  
BOTTOM_ROW     → 11 characters, no spaces  

Before printing, verify:  
- All 47 allowed characters are present exactly once.  
- No characters outside the allowed list appear.

Final output:  
Write only the layout in the format below, with no other text or commentary:

TOP_NUMBER_ROW:  
TOP_ROW:  
HOME_ROW:  
BOTTOM_ROW:
